# passport-js-local-strategy
It is an Example Implementation of Passport JS Local Strategy with very basic form, the main motive is to make you understand how it can be Implemented.

THE .env file has two Environment Variables :-
1- SECRET
2- PORT

The Implementation is Implemented on Heroku, You can get a feel/demo for it here :- https://raxrajpassportjsgit.herokuapp.com/

//This app uses a Local Implementation without any DB, the users information is saved on the Server in an JS object so the for maintainance I keep Resetting the server.
So Sometimes your username might get deleted in such scenario and thus you will have to register.
